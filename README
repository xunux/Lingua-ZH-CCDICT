ABOUT

Lingua::ZH::CCDICT provides an Object-Oriented Perl inteface the
CCDICT Chinese dictionary created by Thomas Chin.

The CCDICT dictionary is a dictionary of Chinese characters and
provides information such as radical, stroke count, multiple
romanizations (for different dialects), and English definitions.

The dictionary itself is distributed under the Open Publication
License.

UTILITIES

See the included make_berkeleydb_files.pl script in bin/ for a simple
way to generate a set of BerkeleyDB files for the dictionary.

BUGS

The CCDICT source has some bugs.  Please report them to me, rather
than the CCDICT maintainer.  This is for two reasons.  Some apparent
dictionary bugs may really be bugs in my code, and it looks like the
maintainer may have gone AWOL, though I'm hoping I'm wrong about that.

It should be noted that the tests expect version 3.2.0 of the
dictionary (which is distributed) with this tarball, and some of them
may fail with other versions.

Please report all bugs via RT at http://rt.cpan.org/
