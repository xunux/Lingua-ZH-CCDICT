- Fixed a bug in turning fifth tone (no tone) pinyin syllables into
Unicode.  The syllable was being turned into '', which is definitely
not right ;)

- Fixed COPYRIGHT sections of docs to specify that the module is
licensed under the same terms as Perl itself, not just the Artistic
License.

- First release.  It seems to work but no doubt has bugs.
