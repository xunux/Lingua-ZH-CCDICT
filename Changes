0.05  2009-09-12

- Fix the all_characters method for the InMemory storage class. RT #44071.


0.04  2007-11-26

- The 0.03 release did not declare Sub::Name as a prereq.


0.03  2007-11-25

* Updated to CCDICT 5.1.1. The data has changed a fair amount, and
  this means a number of API changes. Notably, most of the different
  romanizations are gone, and there is only each for (Hanyu) Pinyin,
  Hakka Pinjim, and Cantonese Jyutping.

- Unicode representations for pinyin with one vowel at the beginning
  of the syllable were not being created at all.

- Fixed an off-by-one error which caused this module to skip the last
  item in the dictionary. Reported by Scott Lanning. RT #27717.

- Changed obsolete() to is_obsolete(). The old version is still
  available, but deprecated.


0.02  2003-02-26

- Fixed a bug in turning fifth tone (no tone) pinyin syllables into
  Unicode.  The syllable was being turned into '', which is definitely
  not right ;)

- Fixed COPYRIGHT sections of docs to specify that the module is
  licensed under the same terms as Perl itself, not just the Artistic
  License.


0.01  2002-08-23 (from Taiwan)

- First release.  It seems to work but no doubt has bugs.
